# Photostation Add-on
QNAP PhotoStation is an web based photo manager that enables managing photos on your QNAP NAS. While the MediaLibrary backend is quite solid (it  indexes & processes new images realtime reliably), the front-end is a bit cumbersome and missing some key features. These have been added via a custom web interface & custom scripts. Key improvements are:

WebApp with:
- Summary view by day
- Single click photo rating
- Clean photo album browser

Shell script:
- Sync ratings from EXIF into MediaLibrary and vice versa
