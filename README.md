# Photostation Addon
QNAP PhotoStation is an web based photo manager that enables managing photos on your QNAP NAS. The front-end lacked some key features that have been manually added via a custom web interface. Key improvements are:

- Single click rating
- Clean photo browser
- Sync ratings back to EXIF of every photo
